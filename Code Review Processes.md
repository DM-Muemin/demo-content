Our code review process is designed to maintain code quality and foster collaboration. We follow these best practices:

Create a code review checklist to ensure consistency across reviews.

Break down large pull requests into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Use a consistent coding style and naming conventions.

Provide constructive feedback and justify your stance.

Focus on readability, security, test coverage, architecture, and reusability.

Reviewers should verify that the code meets feature requirements, assess readability, and check for potential issues. We encourage discussions and questions during the review process to promote knowledge sharing and continuous improvement

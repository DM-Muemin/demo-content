-- Sample SQL script for optimizing PostgreSQL queries
-- Adding an index to improve performance
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);

-- Optimized query using indexed columns
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) 
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01' 
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Analyze slow query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'pending';

-- Vacuum & Analyze for performance tuning
VACUUM ANALYZE orders;

-- Past commit messages related to performance improvements
-- Commit: Optimized query execution for high-load transactions
-- Commit: Added missing indexes on frequently used join columns
-- Commit: Refactored slow queries impacting dashboard load times

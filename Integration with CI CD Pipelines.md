We use GitHub Actions for our CI/CD pipelines, which are configured in the .github/workflows directory of each repository. Our typical pipeline includes the following stages:

1. Linting and Code Style Checks
2. Unit and Integration Testing
3. Security Scans
4. Build Process
5. Deployment to Staging Environment
6. Automated UI Testing
7. Deployment to Production (upon manual approval)

Our CI/CD process ensures that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing the risk of introducing bugs and streamlining our release process. We use environment-specific configuration files to manage different settings for development, staging, and production environments.
By following these practices, we maintain a high-quality codebase, foster collaboration, and ensure efficient development processes. As you begin contributing to our projects, don't hesitate to ask questions or suggest improvements to our workflows. Welcome to the team!

To streamline the contribution process, we maintain a CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repository. This file outlines the following:

How to set up the development environment

Coding standards and style guides

Commit message format

Branch naming conventions

Pull request process

Testing requirements

Documentation expectations

We encourage all contributors to read and follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process. For example, we use conventional commits for our commit messages and require unit tests for all new features

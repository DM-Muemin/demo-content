Each repository contains a comprehensive README.md file that serves as the project's introduction and guide. Our READMEs follow this structure:
  
1. Project Title and Description
2. Motivation
3. Features
4. Installation Instructions
5. Usage Examples
6. API Documentation (if applicable)
7. Contributing Guidelines (link to CONTRIBUTING.md)
8. License Information
9. Contact Information

We ensure our READMEs are kept up-to-date and include visuals such as screenshots or diagrams where appropriate. This helps new team members and external contributors quickly understand the project's purpose and how to get started
